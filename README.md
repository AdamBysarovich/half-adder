# Binary Addition
This post is basically going to be a "how to" on binary addition and how it is used to measure how the circuit is on and off. Binary Addition compared to regular addition is way different with only being ones and zeros it could be confusing for someone who has learned base 10 all of thier life and are just now hearing about it or learning it for the first time. 
0+0=0, and 0+1=1, however 1+1= the equvalent to 10. if you have this happen you would carry the one over like in base 10 addition.

and this is a screenshot from the book showing how this applies to a circuit. basically it signifies the charge and where it is going, the one being the charge and the zero being the not charged part.

In this graph you can see that the charge in each gate could flow from A(XOR) to the S LED and the B(AND) leads to the C out

This picture shows its blank with 0+0 having nothing turned on with the button therefore not having power to any gate or light.

With the B switch or the B side on it goes to the S light. giving only power to the XOR Gate

With both switches on it is a 1+1 for the AND Gate and therefore Cout is on.

They are used in calculators like this and they are used in computers as well, being a part of Digital Processors
